$ this rule is better than set-eq-to-subsets.rule
$ however, it cannot be applied in general because hasDomain only works on atomic sets.

&a = &b

    ~~>

(forAll i : &t1 . i in &a <-> i in &b) /\ 
(forAll i : &t2 . i in &a <-> i in &b)

    where &a hasDomain `set (..) of &t1`
    where &b hasDomain `set (..) of &t2`
    where &t1 hasType `int`
    where &t2 hasType `int`
