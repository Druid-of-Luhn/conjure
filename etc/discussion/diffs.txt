Changes to the language.

rel to relation

forall to forAll

Final decisions:

exponentiation is **
negation is !
implication is ->
iff is <->
only spelling in Essence for all different is allDiff
function domains and constants use --> for arrow

forall is forAll

exponentiation is ^ not **              talk to Pete. everyone wants *.
                  ! vs not              talk to Pete.
                  -> <->                talk to Pete.

:, ::, @, ~~> are operators in the rule language, reserved for the input lang.

(* *) removed, ( ) is used instead

<< , >> for domains, types, constants

"tuple ( , )" is used instead. the tuple keyword is optional for constants, probably only useful for singleton tuples.

tuple indexing uses [ ] not < >

"S" ~~> domToSet(S)

identifier syntax.



Changes to the implementation:

tuple indexing start from 1.

remove "of" from tuple.
forall and forAll
rel and relation
add (optional) "tuple" in front of tuple value constructors.
remove f'(j) syntax. add ' in identifiers.
