This directory contains problem specifications written in Essence,
together with parameter files when needed.

The test is to produce *all* models, find *all solutions* using each and
compare the generated models&solutions to expected ones, found under a
directory called "expected".

The files generated by conjure will be under a directory called "outputs".

A test can be marked "invalid" or "slow" via creating an empty file with the respective file name in their directory.

Use "--select-tests quick/slow/all" in the main tester to select which ones to run.
