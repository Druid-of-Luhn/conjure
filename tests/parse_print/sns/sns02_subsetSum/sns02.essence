given s : int
given nums : set of int
find x : set (minSize 1, maxSize |nums|) of int([ i | i <- nums])
such that x subsetEq nums, s = sum i in x . i


neighbourhood removeElem
using x
such that exists i in x . incumbent(x) = x - {i}

neighbourhood addElem
using x
such that exists i in x . incumbent(x) = x union {i}
