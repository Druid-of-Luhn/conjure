conjure solve [OPTIONS] ESSENCE_FILE [PARAMETER_FILE(s)]
  This is a combined mode, and it is available for convenience. It runs conjure
  in the modelling mode followed by parameter refinement if required, then
  Savile Row + Minion to solve, and then solution translation.

Flags:
     --validate-solutions                    Enable/disable solution
                                             validation. On by default.
Logging & Output:
  -o --output-directory=DIR                  Output directory. Generated
                                             models will be saved here. Default
                                             value: 'conjure-output'
     --numbering-start=INT                   Starting value to output files.
                                             Default value: 1
     --smart-filenames                       Use "smart names" for the
                                             models. Turned off by default.
                                             Caution: With this flag, Conjure
                                             will use the answers when
                                             producing a filename. It will
                                             ignore the order of questions.
                                             This will become a problem if
                                             anything other than 'f' is used
                                             for questions.
     --log-level=LOGLEVEL                    Log level.

     --log-rule-fails                        Generate logs for rule failures.

                                             text files. Conjure can read in
                                             these binary files for further
                                             processing.
