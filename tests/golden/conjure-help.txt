conjure [modelling] [OPTIONS] ESSENCE_FILE
  The main act. Given a problem specification in Essence, produce constraint
  programming models in Essence'.

Logging & Output:
  -o --output-directory=DIR      Output directory. Generated models will be
                                 saved here. Default value: 'conjure-output'
     --numbering-start=INT       Starting value to output files. Default
                                 value: 1
     --smart-filenames           Use "smart names" for the models. Turned off
                                 by default. Caution: With this flag, Conjure
                                 will use the answers when producing a
                                 filename. It will ignore the order of
                                 questions. This will become a problem if
                                 anything other than 'f' is used for questions.
     --log-level=LOGLEVEL        Log level.
     --verbose-trail             Whether to generate verbose trails or not.
     --log-rule-fails            Generate logs for rule failures. (Caution:
                                 can be a lot!)
     --log-rule-successes        Generate logs for rule applications.
     --log-rule-attempts         Generate logs for rule attempts. (Caution:
                                 can be a lot!)
     --log-choices               Store the choices in a way that can be
                                 reused be by -al
Model generation:
  -q --strategy-q=STRATEGY       Strategy to use when selecting the next
                                 question to answer. Options: f (for first), i
                                 (for interactive), r (for random), x (for
                                 all). The letter a (for auto) can be prepended
                                 to automatically skip when there is only one
                                 option at any point. Default value: f
  -a --strategy-a=STRATEGY       Strategy to use when selecting an answer.
                                 Same options as strategy-q. Moreover, c (for
                                 compact) can be used to pick the most
                                 'compact' option at every decision point.  l
                                 (for follow log) tries to pick the given
                                 choices   as far as possible  Default value:
                                 ai
     --channelling               Whether to produce channelled models or not.

                                 default)     false: Select a single
                                 representation.     true : Select multiple
                                 representations.

                                 either be a eprime file (created by
                                 --logChoices), or a json file
