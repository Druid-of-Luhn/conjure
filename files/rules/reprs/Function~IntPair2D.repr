$  Idea is to turn a function from pairs of ints into a 2D matrix
$       function (total)  tuple (int(1..a), int(1..b)) --> int(1..c)
$  into a 2d matrix 
$       matrix indexed by [int(1..a), int(1..b)] of int(1..c)


~~> Function~IntPair2D
~~> matrix indexed by [&a, &b] of &to

    where &a hasType `int`
    where &b hasType `int`

*** function (total) tuple (&a, &b) --> &to
