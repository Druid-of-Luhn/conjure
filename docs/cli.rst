Command Line Interface
======================

Conjure supports a number of commands.
The fist argument is the name of the command, followed by a number of mandatory arguments (if any) depending on the command, and a number of options.
Options can have short or long names. Following the common convention, short option names are preceded by a single dash and long options names are preceded by two dashes.
Options may or may not take arguments.

Hence, the general form of a Conjure invocation is as follows: ``conjure [COMMAND] ... [OPTIONS]``.
