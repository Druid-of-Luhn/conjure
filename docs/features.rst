Features
========

Some features of Conjure.

Some of these are due to features of Conjure's input language Essence, and the
need to support those. If you are not familiar with Essence, please see
:ref:`essence`.


Some features of Conjure

* It works at the problem class level. (See :ref:`features/problem-classes`)
* It is able to generate many Essence' models starting from a single Essence problem specification.
  Each model generated by Conjure can be used to solve the initial problem specified in Essence.


.. _features/problem-classes:

Problem classes
---------------

It works on classes dammit.

Conjure works on parameterised problem specifications -- once a concrete model
is generated using it, the model can be instantiated to solve many instances
from the same class of problems.
