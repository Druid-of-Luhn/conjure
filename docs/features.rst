Features
========

This section lists some features of Conjure.

Some of these are due to features of Conjure's input language Essence, and the need to support those. If you are not familiar with Essence, please see :ref:`essence`.

Problem classes
---------------

Conjure works on parameterised problem specifications -- once a concrete model is generated using it, the model can be instantiated to solve many instances from the same class of problems.


High level of abstraction
-------------------------


Multiple models
---------------

Conjure is able to generate multiple Essence' models starting from a single Essence problem specification.
Each model generated by Conjure can be used to solve the initial problem specified in Essence.

This feature is important because very often a problem can be modelled in several ways, and it is very hard to know what a *good* model is for a given problem.
Constraint programming experts spend considerable amounts of time developing models.
Often, in order to choose a good model, multiple models are created only to evaluate their relative performances for solving the problem at hand.

Moreover, a single good model may not even exist for certain classes of problems.
The choice of the model may depend on the instances we are interested to solve.

Lastly, instead of trying to pick a single good model a portfolio of models may be chosen with complementary strengths to exploit parallelism.

Conjure is able to produce multiple models mainly
- by having choices between multiple representations of decision variable domains, and
- by having choices between translating constraints in multiple ways.

Both domain representation and constraint translation mechanisms are implemented using a rule based system inside Conjure to ease the addition of new modelling idioms.
