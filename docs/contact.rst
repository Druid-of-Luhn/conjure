Contact
=======

Conjure's main developer is
`Özgür Akgün <http://ozgur.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk>`_.
Please get in touch via
`email <ozgur.akgun@st-andrews.ac.uk>`_
if you have comments, suggestions, or if you encounter any problems.

We are particularly interested in hearing specific comments (complaints,
really) about the documentation. Please let us know if something is hard to
understand, not easy to follow, or if the documentation is too sparse at a
certain place.

You can also use the `issue tracker <http://bitbucket.org/stacs_cp/conjure>`_
to report bugs.
