Introduction
============

Conjure is an automated constraint modelling tool for Constraint Programming.

Its input language, Essence, is a high level problem specification language.
Essence allows writing problem specifications at a high level of abstraction
and without having to make a lot of low level modelling decisions.

Conjure reads in abstract problem specifications (in Essence) and produces
concrete constraint programming models in Essence'. Conjure works on
parameterised problem specifications -- once a concrete model is generated
using it, the model can be instantiated to solve many instances from the same
class of problems.

Essence' is a solver independent constraint modelling language. Using the
Savile Row tool, a

Some features of Conjure

* It works at the problem class level. :ref:`features/problem-classes`
* It is able to generate many Essence' models starting from a single Essence
  problem specification. Each model generated by Conjure can be used to solve
  the initial problem specified in Essence.
